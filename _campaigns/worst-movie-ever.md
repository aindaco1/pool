      ## What Is This?

      **Your Money, Your Movie, Our Problem!**

      _The Worst Movie Ever_ is an experimental film production with a dadaist, "exquisite corpse" approach. Each and every donor gets to contribute something that the filmmakers *have* to include in the film. Will they help us? Will they hurt us? They decide!

      This project is centered around the ideas of **collaboration**, **community**, and **chaos**—particularly with regard to the vibrant tapestry of Burqueño culture. It is a filmmaking exercise, an inversion of artistic authority, and a fundraiser for charity.

      ### The Concept

      **Jack McLaughlin has just arrived in Albuquerque!** New to the city and its culture, he begins to explore. Does it welcome him? Does it reject him? Does it do something *weird* to him?

      **You decide.**

      ## Who Are We?

      We are **The Worst Filmmakers**—and we're staying anonymous.

      Why? Because this isn't about us. It's about *you*. The mysterious, possibly antagonistic relationship between the filmmakers and the public is the point. We're here to be tripped up, challenged, and forced to make your terrible ideas work.

      The director(s) will remain publicly anonymous. We're not hiding because we're ashamed (we will be later). We're hiding because the chaos is the star.

      ## What's So Special About This?

      Most crowdfunded films ask you to fund their vision. We're asking you to *destroy* ours.

      **The Tiers Are The Story.** Every pledge level gives you actual control over the film:
      - Upload a frame
      - Submit a sound effect
      - Write dialogue an actor *must* say
      - Design a costume someone *must* wear
      - Force Jack to do *whatever you write*

      This is an **inversion of artistic authority**. The donors become the directors. The filmmakers become the executors of your collective madness.

      ### The Promotional Campaign

      We're not just making a weird film—we're making a weird *experience*:

      - **Trailers**: Professionally shot on telephoto lenses for a voyeuristic feel, featuring Jack in non-sequitur vignettes around Albuquerque
      - **Reels**: 1-2 per week during the campaign—trend-focused, attention-grabbing chaos
      - **Live Events**: A giant psychedelic leg appearing downtown. A masked man dancing around UNM campus. A scavenger hunt across the city.

      We're coming off your phones and into the real world.

      ## What Is Dust Wave?

      Since 2022, **Dust Wave** has been empowering creatives outside of the film industry to pursue their artistic endeavors by creating a community focused on mutual support.

      Since then, we have created **over 20 short films** and built a network of **more than 250 artists** spanning the southwest who share the same passion for independent cinema as we do.

      More information on who we are and what we're about: **[dustwave.xyz/about.html](https://dustwave.xyz/about.html)**

      ## Why Crowdfunding?

      Traditional financing wanted us to make it... *good*? We refused.

      This film needs to be terrible, and that means finding an audience who *gets it* before we shoot a single frame. Your pledge isn't just funding—it's a vote for the kind of cinema that embraces its own awfulness.

      More importantly: **crowdfunding IS the concept**. The film cannot exist without donor contributions. You're not just funding a movie—you're *making* the movie. Every tier is a creative decision. Every backer is a collaborator.

      ## Risks and Challenges

      Let's be honest about what could go wrong:

      **The Obvious Risk:** You might submit something genuinely terrible. That's... kind of the point? But we do have limits.

      ### The Rules

      - No hateful content of any kind will be tolerated in submissions
      - No pornographic images or prompts will be tolerated
      - We reserve the right to reject any submissions considered inappropriate
      - If your submission violates the rules, you'll have the opportunity to revise it. If you don't respond or elect not to revise, the submission will be cut and the donation will **NOT** be refunded

      **The Logistical Challenge:** We're committed to making this film for a near-zero budget. That means creative problem-solving when someone requests "a scene on the moon" or "Jack fights a bear."

      **The Artistic Challenge:** Making a film that's *intentionally* bad but still *watchable* is harder than making a good film. We're walking a tightrope between chaos and coherence.

      **The Promise:** All profits go to charity. The filmmakers get nothing but the satisfaction of surviving your ideas.
