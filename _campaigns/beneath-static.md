      What happens when Alexa picks up a ghost frequency? **BENEATH STATIC** blends found footage, practical FX, and sound design into a 12-minute sci-fi parable about the voices we choose to hear—and the ones we can't ignore.

      ## The Concept

      In 1952, a numbers station broadcast a sequence that was never explained. Seventy years later, a smart speaker in a suburban kitchen starts repeating it.

      We're exploring how technology mediates the uncanny—how the familiar voice of an AI assistant becomes terrifying when it says something it shouldn't know.

      ## Sound Design Focus

      Audio is everything in this film. We're working with field recordings from actual shortwave radios, layered with custom Foley and a minimal synth score.

      The goal: make your smart speaker feel slightly less trustworthy.
