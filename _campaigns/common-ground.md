      When developers threaten to bulldoze the last green space in the neighborhood, four generations must decide what's worth fighting for. **COMMON GROUND** is a 20-minute character study funded entirely by the community it portrays.

      ## A Real Place, Real People

      The Maplewood Community Garden has existed for 47 years. It survived the '80s real estate boom, the 2008 crash, and a city rezoning battle in 2019. Now it faces its greatest threat: a luxury condo development that promises "green space" on the roof.

      We filmed with the actual gardeners. Their stories became our script.
