      **NIGHT WORK** follows three warehouse workers navigating surveillance, quotas, and community in the gig economy. A vérité portrait of labor in the algorithm age.

      No actors. No scripts. Just real workers sharing real stories from the third shift.

      ## The Approach

      We're embedding with workers over six months, building trust before we ever turn on a camera. This isn't exposé journalism—it's portraiture.

      Our subjects will have final cut approval on any footage featuring them. Their stories, their terms.

      ## Why Now?

      The pandemic accelerated warehouse automation and surveillance. Workers are tracked by the second, rated by the algorithm, and replaced without notice. These are the stories that don't make it into quarterly earnings calls.

      We're documenting a moment in labor history that's happening right now, in your city, while you sleep.
