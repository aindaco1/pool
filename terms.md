# Terms & Creative Guidelines

## Pledge Terms

- All pledges are **all-or-nothing**. Your card is saved securely but charged **only if** the campaign reaches its goal by the deadline.
- If a campaign does not reach its funding goal, your card will not be charged.
- You can modify or cancel your pledge anytime before the campaign ends using the magic link in your confirmation email.
- **No account required** — manage your pledge entirely via email links.
- All campaign deadlines use Mountain Time (MST/MDT).

## Payment Processing

- Your card is saved securely by **Stripe** — we never see or store your payment details. No charge is made until the campaign succeeds.
- If a campaign is funded, all pledges from the same email are combined into a single charge.
- A 7.875% tax (ABQ rate) is applied to all pledges.

## Creative Control & Submissions

- You grant us a broad, irrevocable license to use submitted media/text in the production.
- We retain creative discretion; unsafe, illegal, defamatory or unworkable instructions will be rejected.
- Submissions must comply with our content guidelines (no hate speech, harassment, or illegal content).
- We reserve the right to adapt or modify submissions to fit the creative vision and production constraints.

## Fulfillment

- Fulfillment timing may adjust with production realities.
- We will provide regular updates on production progress and delivery timelines.
- Digital rewards will be delivered via email to the address provided during pledge.
- Physical rewards (if applicable) will be shipped to the address you provide after the campaign succeeds.

## Refunds & Cancellations

- **Before funding:** Cancel anytime via your pledge management link. Your card will not be charged.
- **After funding:** Once a campaign reaches its goal and charges are processed, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis.
- Cancelled pledges are never charged.
- Contact us at support@dustwave.xyz for refund requests or issues.

## Privacy & Data

- We collect only the information necessary to process pledges and fulfill rewards: email, name, and payment details.
- Your payment information is stored securely by Stripe and is never accessible to us.
- Email addresses are stored in our system for pledge management, confirmations, campaign updates, and reward fulfillment.
- We do not sell or share your information with third parties except as necessary for payment processing and email delivery.

## Platform & Technology

The Pool is an [open-source crowdfunding platform](https://github.com/aindaco1/pool) built with:

- **Jekyll** — Static site generation, hosted on GitHub Pages
- **Stripe** — Secure card storage and payment processing
- **Cloudflare Workers** — Backend API for pledge storage, stats, and automated campaign settlement
- **Resend** — Transactional emails (confirmations, updates, charge notifications)

Pledge data is stored in Cloudflare KV. This architecture means lower overhead costs and more of your pledge goes directly to the project.
