# Changelog

## v0.9.5 - 2026-05-03

- Aligned local Worker development with GitHub Actions by moving the Podman Worker image to Node 24.
- Updated Worker `compatibility_date` to `2026-05-03` so Wrangler 4 / Miniflare starts cleanly under Node 24.
- Updated host and Podman test wrappers to prefer Node 24, with Node 22 as the minimum Wrangler 4 fallback.
- Switched the Podman Worker dependency bootstrap to `npm ci` so local container starts do not rewrite `worker/package-lock.json`.
- Expanded creator launch documentation with add-ons, hosted embeds, tax/shipping fallback expectations, free-shipping decisions, report recipients, and fulfillment handoff.
- Added a Spanish creator checklist route for fork and creator onboarding.
- Verified the full merge gate, including security suite, host smoke, Podman mutable-pledge smoke, and headless E2E.

## v0.9.4 - 2026-05-02

- Previous milestone for campaign-runner reports, deployment hardening, creator checklist work, and Worker deployment compatibility updates.
